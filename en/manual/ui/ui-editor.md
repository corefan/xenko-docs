You can edit [UI pages](ui-pages.md) and [UI libraries](ui-libraries.md) with the **UI editor**.

To open the editor, in the **asset view**, double-click a **UI page** or **[UI library](ui-libraries.md)**.

The UI editor opens.

![UI editor overview](media/ui-editor-overview.png)

The UI editor comprises:

* the list of [UI libraries](ui-libraries.md) (**A**), which contain the elements (such as buttons and grids) you can add to your UI

* a visual tree of the elements in the UI page (**B**)

* a preview of the UI page as it appears in the game (**C**)

* a property grid (**D**) to edit the properties of your UI elements

## UI libraries

A **UI library** contains **UI elements** (such as grids, buttons, sliders and so on) that you can use and re-use in your UI pages. They work similarly to [prefabs](../game-studio/prefabs/index.md) in the scene editor.

For more information, see [UI libraries](ui-libraries.md).

## Visual tree

The **visual tree** shows the elements in the UI page and their hierarchy. This is similar to the **entity tree** in the scene editor.

![UI asset properties](media/ui-editor-visual-tree.png)

The number in parentheses indicates the number of children an element has. Some elements, such as buttons, can only have one child.

To re-order elements in the visual tree, drag and drop them.

To move an element to a new group, right-click the element and select **Group into**. For example, to create a new grid and move an element into it, right-click the element and select **Group into > Grid**.

## UI preview

The **UI preview** displays a preview of the UI as it appears at runtime. The rendering is equivalent to the rendering in the game, assuming the design resolution is the same as the UI component that uses the edited asset (see [UI Asset properties](#ui-asset-properties)).

By default, the UI is a **billboard**, meaning it always faces the camera. The UI view camera is **orthographic** (see [Cameras](../graphics/cameras.md)). 

You can select, move, and resize elements in the preview as you do in image editing applications.

## Add a UI element to a UI page

To add an element (such as a grid or button), drag it from the **UI library** to the UI page or the **visual tree**.

## Properties

You can view and edit element properties in the **property grid**.

![Property grid!](media/element-property-grid.png)

Properties are sorted by **Appearance**, **Behavior**, **Layout** and **Misc**.

### Appearance

Commonly used properties include `BackgroundColor`, `Opacity`, `Visibility` and `ClipToBounds`.

![Appearance properties](media/appearance-properties.png)

### Behavior

Commonly used properties include whether the element responds to touch events(`CanBeHitByUser`).

![Behavior properties](media/behavior-properties.png)

### Layout

Commonly used properties include the size of the element (`Height`, `Width` and `Depth`), its alignment (`HorizontalAlignment`, `VerticalAlignment`, `DepthAlignement`) and its `Margin`.

![Layout properties](media/layout-properties.png)

### Misc

This category contains only the `Name` of the element.
