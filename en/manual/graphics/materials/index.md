# Materials

**Materials** define the appearance of 3D model surfaces and how they react to light. Without materials, models are simply shapes, blank canvases.

Materials can affect both the geometry of a model (vertex shading) and its colors (pixel shading).

You can use [multiple material layers](material-layers.md) to build more complex materials.

In practice, materials generate partial definitions of shaders integrated as part of the shading of models ([lights and shadows](../lights-and-shadows/index.md)).
